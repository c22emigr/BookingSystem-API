Creating a RESTful booking API built with .NET 8, C#, Entity Framework Core and SQLite.
The purpose of this project is for me to learn more about .NET backend concepts like data modeling, migrations and API-structure.

The API allows booking functionality (CRUD) for managing Users, Resources, and Bookings.

This repository is for learning purposes and should not be used in production in its current state. Sensitive files are excluded using .gitignore.
